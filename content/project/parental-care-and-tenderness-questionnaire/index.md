## Description
The PCAT questionnaire is a measure of individual differences in the activation of the parental care motivational system. It is suitable for administration with both parents and non-parents. There are two formats available:

1. The [original PCAT](#pcat): A 25-item questionnaire with 5 subscales (caring, liking, protection, tenderness-positive, tenderness-negative). 
2. The [PCAT-pn](#pcat-pn): A 10-item short-form with 2 subscales (nurturance and protection). 

These measures are presented below.
