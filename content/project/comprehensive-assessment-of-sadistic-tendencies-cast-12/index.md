**Description:** The CAST-12 is a brief (12-item) multifaceted measure of sadistic personality that assesses three distinct variants: Direct verbal sadism, direct physical sadism, and vicarious sadism.

**Instructions:** Rate your level of agreement or disagreement with each statement using a 5-point scale:

| Strongly</br>Disagree | Disagree | Neither Agree<br>Nor Disagree | Agree | Strongly</br>Agree |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |


1. I was purposely mean to some people in high school.
2. I enjoy making jokes at the expense of others. 
3. I have purposely tricked someone and laughed when they looked foolish.
4. Perhaps I shouldn’t have, but I never got tired of mocking certain classmates.
5. I love to watch YouTube clips of people fighting. 
6. In video games, I like the realistic blood spurts. 
7. I enjoy watching cage fighting (or MMA), where there is no escape. 
8. I sometimes replay my favorite scenes from gory slasher films.
9. I enjoy physically hurting people. 
10. I enjoy tormenting people. 
11. I have the right to push certain people around.
12. I have dominated others using fear.
