**Description:**
The PCAT-pn is a 10-item measure of individual differences in the activation of the parental care motivational system. It is suitable for administration with both parents and non-parents. See also: The ([25-item PCAT questionnaire](https://www.erinbuckels.com/project/parental-care-and-tenderness-questionnaire/)), which contains a broader set of subscales: caring, liking, protection, tenderness-positive, and tenderness-negative.

**Part A**

Instructions: The first part of this questionnaire relates to your personality and personal preferences. Please rate how much you agree or disagree with the following statements:

| Strongly</br>Disagree | Disagree | Neutral | Agree | Strongly</br>Agree |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| 1                     | 2        | 3       | 4     | 5                  |

1. When I see infants, I want to hold them.
2. I would feel compelled to punish anyone who tried to harm a child.
3. I would hurt anyone who was a threat to a child.
4. Babies melt my heart.
5. I would use any means necessary to protect a child, even if I had to hurt others.
6. I would show no mercy to someone who was a danger to a child.

**Part B**

Instructions: TENDERNESS describes a “warm, gentle feeling of sympathetic affection.” Below are various hypothetical scenarios that may or
may not evoke this feeling. Please rate how much TENDERNESS you would feel in each situation. If you are unsure, go with your gut reaction.
