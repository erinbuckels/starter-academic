The CAST-12 is a brief (12-item) measure of sadistic personality. It contains subscales for three distinct variants: Direct verbal sadism, direct physical sadism, and vicarious sadism.

## Instructions
Rate your agreement with each statement using a 5-point scale:

1 = Strongly Disagree<br>
2 = Disagree<br>
3 = Neither Agree Nor Disagree<br>
4 = Agree<br>
5 = Strongly Agree

## Items

1. I was purposely mean to some people in high school.
2. I enjoy making jokes at the expense of others. 
3. I have purposely tricked someone and laughed when they looked foolish.
4. Perhaps I shouldn’t have, but I never got tired of mocking certain classmates.
5. I love to watch YouTube clips of people fighting. 
6. In video games, I like the realistic blood spurts. 
7. I enjoy watching cage fighting (or MMA), where there is no escape. 
8. I sometimes replay my favorite scenes from gory slasher films.
9. I enjoy physically hurting people. 
10. I enjoy tormenting people. 
11. I have the right to push certain people around.
12. I have dominated others using fear. 

## Scoring

CAST-12 total (α = .87) = mean of items 1–12. <br>
