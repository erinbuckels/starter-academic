abstract: Consensus is emerging that the constellation of dark personalities
  should include the sadistic personality. To build a four-factor measure, we
  modified and extended the Short Dark Triad (SD3) measure to include sadism. A
  series of three studies yielded the Short Dark Tetrad (SD4), a four subscale
  inventory with 7 items per construct. Study 1 (N = 868) applied exploratory
  factor analysis (EFA) to a diverse 48-item pool using data collected on MTurk.
  A 4-factor solution revealed a separate sadism factor, as well as a shifted
  Dark Triad. Study 2 (N = 999 students) applied EFA to a reduced 37-item set.
  Associations with adjustment and sex drive provided insight into unique
  personality dynamics of the four constructs. In Study 3 (N = 660), a
  confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the final 28 items showed acceptable fit
  for a four-factor solution. Moreover, the resulting 7-item subscales each
  showed coherent links with the Big Five and adjustment. In sum, the
  four-factor structure replicated across student and community samples.
  Although they overlap to a moderate degree, the four subscales show
  distinctive correlates – even with a control for acquiescence. We also
  uncovered a novel link between sadism and sexuality, but no association with
  maladjustment.
