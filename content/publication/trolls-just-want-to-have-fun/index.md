  In two online studies (total N = 1215), respondents completed personality
  inventories and a survey of their Internet commenting styles. Overall, strong
  positive associations emerged among online commenting frequency, trolling
  enjoyment, and troll identity, pointing to a common construct underlying the
  measures. Both studies revealed similar patterns of relations between trolling
  and the Dark Tetrad of personality: trolling correlated positively with
  sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, using both enjoyment ratings and
  identity scores. Of all personality measures, sadism showed the most robust
  associations with trolling and, importantly, the relationship was specific to
  trolling behavior. Enjoyment of other online activities, such as chatting and
  debating, was unrelated to sadism. Thus cyber-trolling appears to be an
  Internet manifestation of everyday sadism.
