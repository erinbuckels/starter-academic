abstract: Outgroup dehumanization figures centrally in historical intergroup
  violence, yet little is known about the factors that promote dehumanized
  perceptions of others. Drawing on research highlighting the importance of
  disgust-relevant social categorizations and disgust sensitivity to outgroup
  dehumanization, the authors hypothesized that feelings of disgust causally
  facilitate dehumanized social cognition. To test this hypothesis, participants
  (N = 94) were randomly assigned to receive inductions of disgusted, sad, or
  neutral emotions. We then assessed their implicit associations between animals
  and an arbitrary outgroup created with a minimal-groups procedure. Results
  showed that although all participants demonstrated dehumanizing biases,
  disgusted participants showed the strongest associations between the outgroup
  and animals (and the ingroup with humanity). Participants in the sad and
  neutral groups did not differ. Disgust thus appears to have the unique
  capacity to foster the social-cognitive dehumanization of outgroup members.
