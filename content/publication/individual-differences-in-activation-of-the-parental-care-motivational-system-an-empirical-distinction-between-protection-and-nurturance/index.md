abstract: "Previous research reveals that individual differences in parental
  caregiving motives have implications (among both parents and nonparents) for a
  wide range of psychological outcomes. Here we report reanalyses of existing
  data sets to examine the extent to which these outcomes are uniquely predicted
  by two conceptually distinct factors underlying the parental caregiving
  motive: protection and nurturance. In doing so, we also psychometrically
  validate a brief self-report measure designed to efficiently assess individual
  differences in protection and nurturance. Results reveal that individual
  differences in parental protection uniquely predict a specific subset of
  attitudes and judgments (e.g., endorsement of restrictive parenting practices,
  harsher moral judgments of adults who violate social norms), whereas
  individual differences in parental nurturance uniquely predict a different
  subset of attitudes and judgments (e.g., nonparents desire to have children,
  preferences for committed romantic partners, more lenient moral judgments of
  children who violate social norms)."
