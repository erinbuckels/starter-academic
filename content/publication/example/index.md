abstract: "In two online studies (total N = 1215), respondents completed
  personality inventories and a survey of their Internet commenting styles.
  Overall, strong positive associations emerged among online commenting
  frequency, trolling enjoyment, and troll identity, pointing to a common
  construct underlying the measures. Both studies revealed similar patterns of
  relations between trolling and the Dark Tetrad of personality: trolling
  correlated positively with sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, using
  both enjoyment ratings and identity scores. Of all personality measures,
  sadism showed the most robust associations with trolling and, importantly, the
  relationship was specific to trolling behavior. Enjoyment of other online
  activities, such as chatting and debating, was unrelated to sadism. Thus
  cyber-trolling appears to be an Internet manifestation of everyday sadism."
