  Objective: The Dark Tetrad traits (subclinical psychopathy, narcissism,
  Machiavellianism, and everyday sadism) have interpersonal consequences. At
  present, however, how these traits are associated with the accuracy and
  positivity of first impressions is not well understood. The present article
  addresses three primary questions. First, to what extent are perceiver levels
  of Dark Tetrad traits associated with differing levels of perceptive accuracy?
  Second, to what extent are target levels of Dark Tetrad traits associated with
  differing levels of expressive accuracy? Finally, to what extent can Dark
  Tetrad traits be differentiated when examining perceptions of and by others?


  Method: In a round‐robin design, undergraduate participants (N = 412) in small groups engaged in brief, naturalistic, unstructured dyadic interactions before providing impressions of their partner.


  Results: Dark Tetrad traits were associated with being viewed and viewing others less distinctively accurately and more negatively.


  Conclusions: Interpersonal perceptions that included an individual scoring highly on one of the Dark Tetrad traits differed in important ways from interactions among individuals with more benevolent personalities. Notably, despite the similarities between the Dark Tetrad, these traits had unique associations with interpersonal perceptions.
