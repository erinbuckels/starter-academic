abstract: "In common parlance, self-deception is the act of lying to oneself.
  When more rigorous definitions are attempted, this straightforward notion
  quickly becomes complex, if not impossibly paradoxical. Especially problematic
  is the assumption that self-deception is analogous to deceiving others. These
  difficulties have undermined the feasibility of operationalizing the concept
  and conducting research. Despite this checkered history, the possibility of
  confirming the existence self-deception remains so seductive that we enter the
  fray one more time. "
