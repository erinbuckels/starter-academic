abstract: "We report on the development, validation, and utility of a measure
  assessing individual differences in activation of the parental care
  motivational system: The Parental Care and Tenderness (PCAT) questionnaire.
  Results from 1,608 adults (including parents and nonparents) show that the
  25-item PCAT measure has high internal consistency, high test–retest
  reliability, high construct validity, and unique predictive utility. Among
  parents, it predicted self–child identity overlap and caring child-rearing
  attitudes; among nonparents, it predicted desire to have children. PCAT scores
  predicted the intensity of tender emotions aroused by infants, and also
  predicted the amount of time individuals chose look at infant (but not adult)
  faces. PCAT scores uniquely predicted additional outcomes in the realm of
  social perception, including mate preferences, moral judgments, and trait
  inferences about baby-faced adults. Practical and conceptual implications are
  discussed. "
