abstract: Two studies examined the amplitude of the startle response as a
  function of the Dark Tetrad of personality (narcissism, Machiavellianism,
  psychopathy, and sadism). We measured electromyographic activity of the
  orbicularis oculi muscle evoked by a startle stimulus while participants
  viewed images on a computer screen. Both studies revealed a negative
  correlation between general startle reactivity (averaged across positive,
  negative, and neutral images) and sadistic tendencies. In Study 2, all four
  dark traits were negative correlates of general startle reactivity. Study 2
  also examined the personality correlates of aversive startle potentiation
  (ASP; indexed by greater reactivity while viewing negatively-valenced images
  than positive or neutral images). ASP correlated negatively with a variety of
  personality measures of psychopathy and sadism, their facets, and related
  personality tendencies (callousness, risk-taking, and restricted affect).
  These findings suggest that ordinary people with high levels of callousness
  and antagonism display physiological evidence of non-reactivity (i.e., blunted
  acoustic startle in general), whereas psychopathy and sadism are
  preferentially associated with reduced ASP.
