abstract: Past research on socially aversive personalities has focused on
  subclinical psychopathy, subclinical narcissism, and Machiavellianism—the
  “Dark Triad” of personality. In the research reported here, we evaluated
  whether an everyday form of sadism should be added to that list. Acts of
  apparent cruelty were captured using two laboratory procedures, and we showed
  that such behavior could be predicted with two measures of sadistic
  personality. Study 1 featured a bug-killing paradigm. As expected, sadists
  volunteered to kill bugs at greater rates than did nonsadists. Study 2
  examined willingness to harm an innocent victim. When aggression was easy,
  sadism and Dark Triad measures predicted unprovoked aggression. However, only
  sadists were willing to work for the opportunity to hurt an innocent person.
  In both studies, sadism emerged as an independent predictor of behavior
  reflecting an appetite for cruelty. Together, these findings support the
  construct validity of everyday sadism and its incorporation into a new “Dark
  Tetrad” of personality.
